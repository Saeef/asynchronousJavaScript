# Callback functions (..& chaining callbacks) . :collision:  :violin:  :boom:
- Callback functions are functions that are passed as arguments into other functions to be executed at a later point in time.
- Callbacks can be created and used without being bound to a specific function name.
- Anonymous callbacks are useful when a callback is only needed to be declared once.

### how callback functions are used:  :lemon: &nbsp; :sake:

```
      //multiplies two numbers
      function mult(x,y) {
          return x * y;
      }
      
      //adds to numbers
      function add(x,y) {
        return x + y;
      }
      
      //uses a callback to process two numbers
      function calculate(x,y,compute) {
        return compute(x,y);
      }
      
      var a = calculate(10,5,add);   //useds add callback
      console.log(a);
      
      var b = calculate(10,5,mult);
      console.log(b);  //logs 50
      
      //uses an anonymous callback
      var c = calculate(10,5m function(x,y) {
            return x- y;  //substracts y from x
      });
      
      console.log(c);  //logs 5
      
      //an anonymous callback used with arrow functions
      var d = calculate(10,5, (x,y) => {return x - y});   //using arrow functions
      
      console.log(d);   // logs 5

```

## Callback Examples . :bug: :bug:

### map() :hatched_chick:
The map() method calls a callback function on each element in the array and the returns a new array with those results

```
      var array = [1,2,3,4,5];
      
      var newarray = array.map(function(x) {
           return x*x; 
                              //uses an anonymous callback function to square each element
      });  //newarray
      
      console.log(newarray);        //logs [2,4,6,8,10]

```

### filter() :lemon:
The filter() method removes elements in an array that do not pass a certain criteria defined by a callback function .      
Ex => uses filter() method to remove elements in an array that are not even

```
      var arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
      
      function isEven(x) {
         if(x % 2 == 0) {
            return x;  
         }
      }//isEven
      
      var newarray = arr.filter(isEven);
      
      console.log(newarray);        //logs [2,4]

```

# Chaining Callbacks :key: :zzz: :key:
- The Continuation Passing Style (CPS) is a programming style used to chain callback functions together.    
- In CPS, methods with callback functions as arguments are called within other callback functions.
- CPS is known by having methods that have callback functions as their last arguments.

```
      function myFunc(x,callback) {
            callback(x);
      }
      
      var answer = 0;
      
      myFunc(10, function(x) {   //callback 1
            var result = x * x;     //result 100
      
            myFunc(result, function(x) {  //callback 2 within callback 1
                  var result2 = x + x;   //result2 = 200
            
                  myFunc(result2, function(x) {  //callback 3 within callback 2
                      answer = x + 100;
                      console.log(answer);    //logs 300
                  })
               
            })
      
      });  //myFunc

```

## SetTimeout()  :ant: &nbsp; :watch:
- The setTimeout() method is used to schedule a task to be put on the event queue after given amount of time.
- The first parameter to setTimeout() is the callback function to be executed.
- The second parameter is the amount of time to wait before putting the task on the event queue.
- SetTimeout() is non-blocking, and other code may run while the setTimeout() task is waiting to be executed.

```
      setTimeout(function() {
            console.log('yello');
      },1000);   //waits one sec
```

## clearTimeout()  :hourglass:
- The clearTimeout() function is used to cancel a timeout that is still pending.      
- The setTimeout() method call returns a numeric timerID that is used to identify the timer.
- This timerID can be passed into the clearTimeout() method call to stop the timer.

```
      var timeout = setTimeout(function() {
            console.log('yello');
      },1000);
      
      clearTimeout(timeout);  //clears the setTimeout callback from running
```

## setInterval()
- SetInterval method is used to schedule a reocurring task to be put on the event queue every time a given number of miliseconds elapses.
- The first parameter is the callback function that is going to be executed.
- The second parameter is the amount of time to wait before the reocurring task is put back on the event queue.

```
      var count = 0;
      
      var interval = setInterval(function() {
            count++;
            console.log(count);
            if(count >= 5) {
                  clearInterval(interval);
            }
            
      },1000);    //executes callback every second

```

## clearInterval()  :confetti_ball:
- The clearInterval method is used to stop an interval timer set by setInterval().
- Example above uses to stop count after five times. (called inside of interval)


## Asynchronous Code using Timers
- Synchronous code is run line by line in the order in which the code occurred.
- Asynchronous code may be executed in a different order than how it originally ocurred.
- Asynchronous code is non-blocking and will only run when the call stack is empty

> Asynchronous code can be shown by using a setTimeout() method call with a timerout value of 0. This will immediately put a task on the event queue.   :bulb:
