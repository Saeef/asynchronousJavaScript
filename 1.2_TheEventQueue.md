## The Event Queue
- The event queue is a queue that keeps track of tasks that are waiting to be put on the call stack to be executed.
- Tasks get added to the Event Queue by Web APIs that run in parallel with the javascript runtime.

Ex web APIs that add tasks to the event queue:
 -  timers schedule tasks to be added to event queue
 -  DOM event handlers - user interactions such as mouse clicks and keyboard presses are handled by putting tasks on the event queue
 -  Network requests - network requests are processed asynchronously and send back results by putting tasks on the event queue
