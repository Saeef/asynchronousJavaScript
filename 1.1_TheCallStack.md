# The call stack
The call stack tracks functions that are currently active and are being processed.

- when a function call is encountered, it is pushed onto the call stack.
- any additional function called within the original function are placed higher up on the call stack.
- when a function finishes executing, it is popped off the call stack and the next function on the call stack is processed

### Stack Overflow
If the call stack grows too large and exceeds the amount of memory allocated, a Stack Overflow Error will occur. This commonly happens when a function calls itself recursively.

```
    function fnA() {
      fnA();            <-------------  how a stack overflow error can occur (fnA keeps getting called recursively)   
    }                                / 
                                    /
    fnA();             <-----------

```
