# The call stack
The call stack tracks functions that are currently active and are being processed.

![](/images/callstack.png)

- when a function call is encountered, it is pushed onto the call stack.
- any additional function called within the original function are placed higher up on the call stack.
- when a function finishes executing, it is popped off the call stack and the next function on the call stack is processed

```
   function fnA() {
      fnB();
   }
   
   function fnB() {
      fnC();
   }
              
   function fnC() {         <---------- fnC is at the top of the call stack because it was called last  
      console.log(Error().stack);       //Error is only used to show the call stack
   }
   
   fnA();     <---- fnA is at the bottom of the call stack because it was called first.

```
