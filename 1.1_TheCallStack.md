The call stack tracks functions that are currently active and are being processed.

- when a function call is encountered, it is pushed onto the call stack.
- any additional function called within the original function are placed higher up on the call stack.
- when a function finishes executing, it is popped off the call stack and the next function on the call stack is processed
