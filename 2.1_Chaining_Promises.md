## Using Promises with Then() and Catch()
- The __then()__ and __catch()__ methods are used to handle the results of __Promises__ once they have finished pending.
- The __then()__ method is used to handle __resolved__ Promises.
- The __catch()__ method is used to handle __rejected__ Promises.
- Both of these methods use callback functions.
- The callback functions should each have one argument representing the Promise result.
